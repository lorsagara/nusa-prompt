    "prompt": "Transform the attached reference photo into a high-quality 3D chibi-style version of the same person.\n\nPreserve the original facial identity and structure from the reference image, including face shape, jawline, cheekbone placement, eye shape and spacing, nose shape, lip shape, and overall facial proportions. Do not redesign, replace, or reinterpret the face into a generic chibi look. The chibi character must clearly resemble the same person when viewed side by side with the reference photo.\n\nApply chibi stylization by exaggerating proportions only: the head is extremely large and softly rounded, dominating most of the character’s height. The torso is extremely small, compact, and stubby. The character must appear toy-sized and palm-sized, small enough to fit entirely in an adult hand, like a collectible baby chibi or vinyl figure.\n\nLimb proportions are strictly and permanently locked:\nArms and legs must be extremely short, stubby, and chubby. Upper arms, forearms, thighs, and calves are minimal in length. Elbows are barely visible or only implied. Hands are small, rounded, with very short simplified fingers.\nArm length hard lock: the total shoulder-to-hand length must be NO LONGER than the height of the character’s head. Hands must be positioned close to the torso at upper waist or chest level and must NOT hang down toward the hips or thighs.\nLegs are very short and appear almost directly attached to the torso. Feet are small, rounded, and compact.\nAvoid long limbs, slim arms, long legs, or any realistic adult anatomy. The body must not read as a scaled-down human.\n\nHairstyle must remain the same as the reference image, including hair length, direction, volume, and parting, adapted into a chibi-friendly form without changing the style. Outfit may be simplified into a chibi version but must remain consistent with the reference image’s clothing style and identity.\n\nAdd interaction: an adult human hand gently pinching the character’s cheek from the side. The hand must be clearly adult-sized and significantly larger than the character’s head, dominating the frame to emphasize scale. The cheek pinch creates a soft, natural cheek deformation and feels playful and gentle, not exaggerated or painful.\n\nEye direction and interaction are mandatory and locked: the character must NOT look at the camera. The eyes must clearly look toward the hand pinching the cheek, with visible eye rotation and pupil shift toward the fingers. The gaze should feel curious and reactive, as if the character is aware of the cheek being pinched. A slight head tilt toward the hand is allowed to enhance interaction.\n\nFacial expression remains close to the reference image: calm, neutral, and subtly softened by the cheek pinch. Avoid overly cute, anime-like, cartoonish, or exaggerated expressions.\n\nOverall impression: the character looks like a small physical toy or figurine placed in a real environment, not a resized normal human. Avoid realistic adult body proportions entirely.\n\nRendering style: high-quality 3D chibi render, collectible figure quality, realistic materials with soft lighting, smooth skin, clean details. No anime redesign, no Pixar-style replacement, no stylized character swap.\n\nCamera: front-facing, eye-level relative to the character, medium full-body framing. Aspect ratio 9:16 vertical. High resolution, sharp focus.\n\nDo not add text, watermark, logo, captions, unrelated props, extra characters, scene changes, horror elements, exaggerated cartoon distortion, blur, noise, or low-quality rendering.",
